			<h2>Me in 10 seconds</h2>

				<p>I'm a musician, programmer, writer, entrepreneur, and student - though not in that order.</p>
				<p>I'm fascinated with the usable psychology of self-improvement, business, philosophy, and intercultural relativism. I love seeing a different point of view.</p>
				<p>Total introvert (INTJ). I thrive in solitude.</p>
				<p>Minimalist. I prefer giving to getting.</p>
				<p>California native. I now live in New Zealand, Singapore, and Belgium.</p>
				<p>Deeply happy and anti-drama, my favorite fable is 塞翁失马.</p>
				<p>CURRENT UPDATE: <a href="now.html">Here's what I'm doing now.</a></p>
